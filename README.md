# Vim8.0-Settings-for-Python
  This is My Private Settings for Vim8.0 learned from the Internet. <br>
  First I want to show my appreciation to the authors of the plugins and some vimers who taught me how to edit .vimrc.  <br>
  This file contains necessary plugins and settings. But before using that, make sure you've installed Vundle in your vim folder. You can find it at Github. Then launch your vim and input the following order "PluginInstall" ,and Vundle will download and install the plugins for you automatically. <br>
  There are 3 places for you to pay attention to. First is the Vundle path. Please use your own path. Second, to use maralla/completor.vim, you need to download jedi and modify the path using your own. <br> Third, because I've used anaconda3 to creat a virtual environment in order to install tensorflow, so I add my path into the sys.path. <br>
  The "F5 Python Runner" was taught by Chinese vimers. Thank you. <br>
  If you want to know more about the plugins, just search them at Github. After downloading the plugins, don't forget to star them<^.^>  <br>
  Have fun coding with Vim!
